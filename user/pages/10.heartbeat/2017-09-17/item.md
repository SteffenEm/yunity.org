**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## Foodsaving Worldwide Summer Camp / Hackweek
The whole of the [foodsaving tool team](https://blog.foodsaving.world/team.en.html) and more gathered in Neuried to work on progressing code, improving structure and clarifying questions of identity with regards to [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de). Productivity is high and the event is going on still!

### [Karrot](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/) - _the former foodsaving tool_
The many names with 'food' are confusing and 'foodsaving tool' is not the most catchy name there is, right? So we started a sore voting process to come up with a better name. The winner was *Karrot* and we will never talk about the 'foodsaving tool' again... ;)

#### Switch of frontend frameworks
We started off with AngularJS 1 and since had many discussions about it. Now things changed, as Angular Material doesn't seem to be updated anymore. That's why we started a [big envaluation of frontend frameworks](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/593) and used this hackweek to fix the decision of using Vue.js and Quasar in the future.

The biggest change probably is the use of [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/intro.html), which allows for global state management and nicer data flow solutions. A lot of refactoring and rewriting is about to happen now, but we're postive that it will prove useful in the long run. Also, we use the productivity boost of being in one spot to get done as much as possible in the smartest possible way.

## [Ukuvota](https://ukuvota.gitlab.io/)
yunity.org has a new subproject listed! It is the score voting app  Ukuvota (the name is Zulu vor 'voting') and if you want to contribute, feel free to have a look at the [gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/ukuvota). :)
